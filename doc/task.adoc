== Description on Udemy:
- Create a program that implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities.
- Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
- You will want to create a separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
- Create a master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
- The mobile class has the functionality listed above.
- Add a menu of options that are available.
- Options: quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact, and search/find contact.
- When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exist (use name).
- Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the ArrayList to MobilePhone. (e.g. not ints, not .get(i) etc.).
- MobilePhone should do everything with Contact objects only.
